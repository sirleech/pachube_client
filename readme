An Arduino Ethernet datalogger sending a feed to Pachube.com. The internal watchdog timer is used along with a hard reset to the Ethernet Shield from digital pin 9. Original code is forked from the article:

**************
You will need 
Arduino Uno (with Optiboot bootloader)
Freetronics Ethernet Shield

Reset Pin
> int resetPin = 9; //reset pin to manually reset the ethernet shield
Jumper is added to Pin 9 and soldered to the WIZ_RST pad of the Ethernet Shield

Software note:

You will need the EthernetDHCP library from:
http://gkaindl.com/software/arduino-ethernet/dhcp/

- Arduino IDE 0021
- EthernetDHCP Version 1.0b4
